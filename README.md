A sidebar is the combination of various navigation links that align on the web page's right or left side and helps to faster move from one web page to another to the users. The main purpose to create a sidebar is for small sizes screen devices like tablets, mobile.

There is only one difference between the side navigation bar and the navigation bar is, the navigation bar is a large screen size device like a laptop, computer, and side navigation from small sizes devices. Actually, we convert the navigation menu to the side navigation menu.
